# Welcome to Lettuce Cryptography

## Objective

## Workflow

Begin by downloading the repository on your system.  
`git clone https://github.com/CS-UCR/senior-design-project-lettuce-cryptography.git`
> Note: You need only do this once.

Before making contributions, if your contribution will consist of many tasks and/or be completed in stages, feel free to create a project board for yourself.
The project boards are located under the 'Projects' tab.

To make contributions to the project, make a separate branch.  
`git checkout -b <USERNAME>/<TASK>` eg: `git checkout -b QuarterShotofEspresso/ReadMeModifications`

After committing your changes, push them to github.  
`git push origin <USERNAME>/<TASK>`

Once the modifications are completed they need to be merged with the main branch.
> Note: Notify everyone before running the following commands.

`git checkout main`  
`git merge <USERNAME>/<TASK>`  
`git push origin main`  
> Note: Resolve merge conflicts if they appear.

If you have created a project (under the projects tab), move the task to the correct column.
If the project is now completed, please close it to avoid clutter.

Whenever the remote main branch is updated, everyone's local main branch must be updated.  
`git checkout main`  
`git pull --rebase origin main`  
`git checkout <USERNAME>/<TASK>`  
`git pull --rebase origin main`  
> Note: Resolve merge conflicts if they appear.
